## Overview 
 **Electronic commerce experienced significant growth as a result of its resurgence over the internet and network technologies, resulting in a flow of customers into online shopping for major platforms like Amazon, Target, Walmart, etc. Positive and negative customer reviews greatly influence the choice a buyer makes before making an online purchase by giving them a better explanation of the product's features and functionality and allowing them to compare it to other products of a similar nature. Information on the product and suggestions for how the merchant could enhance their services are also given. Sentiment analysis, sometimes referred to as opinion mining, is a key activity of NLP (Natural Language Processing). It is a way to display feeling, thought, judgement, or expression and would be used to examine the feelings of the target audience towards an object. By analyzing the entire text to produce a classified sentiment, it detects both positive and negative opinions. Consumers today have far greater flexibility to voice their ideas and opinions, which can assist businesses in customizing their goods and services. Companies develop systems to assess consumer feedback and many interactions across various platforms in order to meet customer needs as a result of technology advancements in the fields of automation and machine learning.
